# testingHighmapsGeoJSON


### The current code has several examples which the title name imply:

-SelectCharlotte
-SelectCounties
-SelectLaredo
-SelectNC
-Select States

Each of these html files contain references to local js files, and can be replaced for the ones from highcharts or include them in your local files.
There are 2 variants:

## Maps in JS provided by Highmaps Collection 
-Counties
-States

	These are the ones working locally because uses the js file to load the locations.

## Maps used by GeoJSON files:
-SelectCharlotte
-SelectLaredo
-SelectNC

These require to deploy locally to avoid the error because of getJSON method

Currently I've included some examples at JSFiddle
